### West Coast Pre-Trip Stuff

_9/18/2012_

[![enso tattoo](/img/blogspot-stuff-27-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-27.jpg "enso tattoo")

The pre-trip tattoo is very important, I think. When translated, this tattoo means:

> Leaf after leaf in the pure wind, As I see you off at the gate, there are tall bamboo. Just for you, their leaves are raising a pure wind.

I got it done on Monday at Marks of the Spark in Frederick. Alfie and his wife own the business, and he does all of the tattoos. I talked to him some before he started, and he said that in January they will have been in business for 20 years in Frederick. Very cool. I got this design from a book of enso paintings. Enso just means 'circle' in Japanese, but it's traditionally the symbol of enlightenment in Zen, and a lot of the old Zen masters have drawn the circle in their own way. I looked through a lot of them, and this one jumped out at me. I still liked it a couple months later, so now it's on my body.

[![planning with post-its](/img/blogspot-stuff-28-tn.JPG)](/img/blogspot-stuff-28.JPG "planning with post-its")

Also, planning. I took some pages out of my old road atlas and taped them up on the wall. I found a lot of info about where to go and what to see, but I didn't know where a lot of these places were in relation to each other, so I mapped it all out. I'm planning to be on the road for 5 and 1/2 weeks, starting on the 20th of September. Here we go.


### West Coast Day 1 - MD to Stone Mountain State Park, NC

_9/20/2012_

[![campsite setup](/img/blogspot-stuff-29-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-29.jpg "campsite setup")

This trip was only about 6 hours, but now I remember why I dislike interstates. Every other vehicle on the road was a semi on I-81 and I-77. Oh well, I listened to some good music and sang along to Creedence so it wasn't all bad. And I downloaded a lot of talks from Gil Fronsdal before I left. He's a Buddhist teacher somewhere in California, I'm not sure where. I need to find out and maybe stop in while I'm out that way.

[![dinner of champions](/img/blogspot-stuff-30-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-30.jpg "dinner of champions")

Anyway, it wasn't too hard to find the park, and the route I took had me on the Blue Ridge Parkway for 10 miles or so. Got to see some mountains off in the distance, and I passed a lot of motorcycles going the other way. I stopped at Walmart during the day and bought some hotdogs and buns, so once I got a fire going I roasted the dogs on a sharpened stick. I ate four, they were delicious. It was cold out too, so I slept pretty good.

[![embers](/img/blogspot-stuff-31-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-31.jpg "embers")


###  West Coast Day 2 - NC to Stockbridge, GA

_9/21/2012_

When I got up I saw a few deer wanderina through the campground a couple of sites down. They acknowledged me and went about their grazing. The campground had hot showers, so I got off to a good start.

Still a lot of semis on the road. Didn't matter, because I kinda tuned everything out today and just drove. Stopped at Chickfila for breakfast and Waffle House for lunch. Two of my favorite places in one day! Once I got to my parents house, I talked to Dad for a little bit since he was home on his day off. Then he enlisted me to move the freezer from the garage down to the basement. I guess I have to earn my lodging somehow.

The rest of the day was the usual good times with family: cooking, drinking, talking, alcoholic pudding, etc. Lilly is still skinny but alive. The other two cats are still fat and retarded. Forgot to take pictures of anything today.


### West Coast Day 3 - GA to Trace State Park, MS

_9/22/2012_

I am currently typing all of the previous entries up through today at the campground. I got here without much fuss, pretty much highway all the way. And not a lot of traffic at all once I got clear of Atlanta. I stopped for lunch at a Subway, but there must have been 30 people in line when I got there. Looked like a girls soccer team had just arrived. So I went unwillingly to the McD's next door, which I guess is technically food, but only technically.

Anway this park is kinda cool, they have a lot of trails for horses and ATVs and dirt bikes and stuff. I forgot that I gain an hour since I'm in Central time now, so I had extra time to wander around the woods. None of those trails was marked very well, and there were a lot of side trails, so I did my best to make a big loop. There were a lot of deer in the woods, I probably saw 20 of them, in groups of 2s and 3s.

And there was a 'nature trail', which was just a flat trail that wound around beside one of the lakes for maybe a mile and a half. I ran some of that, it was fun. I need to stay in shape to do Half Dome, and right now I'm sitting in the car for most of the day.

Now the stars are coming out, and I'm typing on the laptop in the dark. The sun went down around 7:30, which is crazy. The tattoo still itches and I want to scratch it but I can't. Gonna read for a bit and pass out. Forgot to take pictures again. Peace.


### West Coast Day 4 - MS to Devils Den State Park, AR

_9/23/2012_

Packed up, got a shower, and got on the road by 8am this morning. A week ago I was still asleep by then, although it is Central time so that's less impressive.

[![tunnel time](/img/blogspot-stuff-32-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-32.jpg "tunnel time")

The highlight of the drive today was a 'scenic overlook' that was basically a kind-of high point with a view of a lake. I took a picture of it, I don't know why. Then at some point there was a tunnel, almost as good. I found a Starbucks on the 2nd try (stupid GPS) so I could finally post stuff from the previous days. It was only supposed to be 7 hours of driving today, but with detours and what not I didn't get to the park until 530pm. Oh well.

[![rock wall at Devil's Den](/img/blogspot-stuff-33-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-33.jpg "rock wall at Devil's Den")

The park was pretty cool. There was still some light, so I hiked a couple of the trails and remembered to bring my camera this time. Once I was done with that I set up camp and made dinner. Tomorrow will be an even longer day on the road.

[![interesting trails](/img/blogspot-stuff-34-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-34.jpg "interesting trails")

[![cool rock formations](/img/blogspot-stuff-35-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-35.jpg "cool rock formations")

**Side note:** Car issues. When I changed the oil before I left for this trip, I wanted to change the air filter, but forgot to buy one. So I picked one up on the 3rd day, and then found out that the screws were too tight for my ratcheting screwdriver. So I bought a simple phillips head today, no problem. But the last screw was so tight that I stripped out the frigging head. Ugh. Thankfully it also takes a socket, which of course I didn't bring. So now I have to get that tomorrow. Assuming that goes well I might just have this replaced.


### West Coast Day 5 - AR to Palo Duro Canyon State Park, TX

_9/24/2012_

Woke up early, broke camp, and had to wait until 8am at the visitor center to pay for the campsite. Oh well.

[![windmills](/img/blogspot-stuff-36-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-36.jpg "windmills")

Today was the day of driving through Oklahoma. All of it was on I-40. All day. Everything started out kinda flat, and slowly got flatter and flatter. It was windy like crazy, which I suppose is why they have wind generators all over the place. Somewhere in the middle I stopped for lunch, gas, and walmart. Now I have sockets so I can finally change out my air filter. Hooray.

[![wide view of the canyon](/img/blogspot-stuff-37-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-37.jpg "wide view of the canyon")

[![layers](/img/blogspot-stuff-38-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-38.jpg "layers")

[![lizard](/img/blogspot-stuff-39-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-39.jpg "lizard")

PD Canyon is kind of awesome as it turns out. Not Grand Canyon awesome, but very cool in its own way. I didn't get there until 5pm, so not a lot of time for hiking. But there was a 1.5 mile trail that went from a lookout point near the visitors center down to the canyon floor, and I hiked that. It turned out to be a really cool hike, all downhill. Then of course I turned around and walked back the other way, which was not so fun in the 90 degree (dry) heat, but I made it happen.

[![more canyon](/img/blogspot-stuff-40-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-40.jpg "more canyon")

All of the campsites are down inside the canyon, which is where I'm staying tonight. It's pretty windy still, hope I don't blow away.


### West Coast Day 6 - TX to Mesa Verde NP, CO

_9/25/2102_

There were supposed to be tarantulas all over the place in Texas since it's their breeding season, or so I was told. I didn't see any until I was leaving the park. They were running across the road, and I tried not to hit them with the car. Mostly successful.

[![long flat highway](/img/blogspot-stuff-41-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-41.jpg "long flat highway")

So today was a 10-hour day on the road. It started out flat and boring in Texas, but eventually I got through New Mexico and into Colorado, where they have mountains. So that was a nice change of pace.

[![mesas](/img/blogspot-stuff-42-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-42.jpg "mesas")

At some point after lunch, it started hailing on one of the mountains. That was the first precipitation so far on the trip. And now it's pretty cold here. I passed a couple of places where there was a little bit of snow on the ground.

[![cave dwellings](/img/blogspot-stuff-43-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-43.jpg "cave dwellings")

Since I spent so much time on the road, I got to the park too late to tour the cliff dwellings. Oh well, I got a picture of what there was to see from the beginning of the trail, then set up camp. It's still cold. Glad I brought my warm sleeping bag. And it turns out they have wifi here at the camp, so I'll be able to do some internets in the morning.

I had just had knee surgery so I didn't get to hike around, but I was blown away. And there's a crocodile park near it that I wanted to stop at...


### West Coast Day 7 - Bryce Canyon, UT

_9/26/2012_

[![four corners](/img/blogspot-stuff-45-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-45.jpg "four corners")

So I thought today would be a relatively shorter day, so I took my time getting going from Mesa Verde. And then I stopped at Four Corners, which was kind of a waste of time. A piece of metal in the ground, and a bunch of Native Americans selling their wares all around. Oh well, it only cost $3 and an hour of my time.

[![mesa or butte or something](/img/blogspot-stuff-46-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-46.jpg "mesa or butte or something")

There are lots of mesas and buttes and weird rock formations along the way now. And mountains. Real mountains, not the hills we have on the east coast.

[![desert highway](/img/blogspot-stuff-47-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-47.jpg "desert highway")

[![driving between mountains](/img/blogspot-stuff-48-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-48.jpg "driving between mountains")

[![bryce canyon formations](/img/blogspot-stuff-49-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-49.jpg "bryce canyon formations")

Bryce Canyon seems like an interesting place, but I didn't get to see anything today because the trip took so much longer than I expected. I only had time to set up camp and eat dinner in the dark. And make a fire, of course. All the important camp things.

[![moon behind clouds](/img/blogspot-stuff-50-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-50.jpg "moon behind clouds")

Also, I don't know what I ate yesterday, but it's hard to be in the same car as myself today. And too hot to keep the windows down.


### West Coast Day 8 - Great Basin NP, NV

_9/27/2012_

[![cold morning, frosty car](/img/blogspot-stuff-51-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-51.jpg "cold morning, frosty car")

It was friggin cold last night at Bryce Canyon, somewhere in the mid 30s. So I packed up and drove out of the park to get some bacon and eggs for breakfast. Much better.

[![view from top of the canyon](/img/blogspot-stuff-52-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-52.jpg "view from top of the canyon")

I came back and hiked a loop trail that wound down a couple miles into the canyon and back up, saw a lot of cool rocks.

[![more cool rock formations](/img/blogspot-stuff-53-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-53.jpg "more cool rock formations")

[![good balance](/img/blogspot-stuff-54-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-54.jpg "good balance")

[![natural switchbacks down into the canyon](/img/blogspot-stuff-55-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-55.jpg "natural switchbacks down into the canyon")

[![rocks getting some sun](/img/blogspot-stuff-56-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-56.jpg "rocks getting some sun")

[![looks cold up in those mountains](/img/blogspot-stuff-57-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-57.jpg "looks cold up in those mountains")

The drive was easy today, finally, and I got to Great Basin in plenty of time to hike around. I would have liked to hike up to the mountain peak at 13000 ft, but I didn't have enough time for that. So I settled for a loop trail that included a couple of cool mountain lakes.

[![evergreens and snow-capped peaks](/img/blogspot-stuff-58-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-58.jpg "evergreens and snow-capped peaks")

[![mountain reflections in the lake](/img/blogspot-stuff-59-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-59.jpg "mountain reflections in the lake")

[![i want to hike up there](/img/blogspot-stuff-60-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-60.jpg "i want to hike up there")

[![awesome background](/img/blogspot-stuff-61-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-61.jpg "awesome background")

Hopefully I'll have time to see Lehman Cave tomorrow morning before driving to Reno. And the car is still doing good, getting about 34mpg. Thanks, Honda.


### West Coast Day 9 - Reno, NV

_9/28/2012_

[![lots of little stalactites hanging down](/img/blogspot-stuff-62-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-62.jpg "lots of little stalactites hanging down")

Since I'll be in a hotel tonight, and I don't have to worry about setting up camp and cooking dinner before sundown, I took the Lehman Cave tour this morning. It was about an hour and a half of underground wandering, led by a park ranger with a very dry sense of humor. All in a cool 50 degree temperature. It was fun.

[![looks like they would break if you touched them](/img/blogspot-stuff-63-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-63.jpg "looks like they would break if you touched them")

[![floor and ceiling](/img/blogspot-stuff-64-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-64.jpg "floor and ceiling")

[![floor and ceiling meeting together](/img/blogspot-stuff-65-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-65.jpg "floor and ceiling meeting together")

[![looks like a fungus](/img/blogspot-stuff-66-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-66.jpg "looks like a fungus")

[![like a mushroom pipe organ](/img/blogspot-stuff-67-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-67.jpg "like a mushroom pipe organ")

[![80mph, nice](/img/blogspot-stuff-69-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-69.jpg "80mph, nice")

After than I drove for forever on highway 50 through Nevada. In my road atlas it calls it "The Loneliest Road." Seriously, there's nothing on this road in between towns that are 60 or 70 miles apart. Not a good place to break down.

[![pizza and beer](/img/blogspot-stuff-68-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-68.jpg "pizza and beer")

Eventually I got to Reno, where I'm staying at the Atlantis. A combination casino, hotel, restaurant, spa, etc. Just what I need after a week in the woods. I had pear & fontina pizza, which was delicious. Then I lost $20. Tomorrow I have to find somewhere to do laundry, then drive back to the woods.


### West Coast Day 10 - Eldorado National Forest, CA

_9/29/2012_

Found a laundromat in Reno this morning, and hung out there for a while to get laundry done. Wearing my laundry day clothes, looking like a bum.

Then back on the road, and finally into California!

[![give a hoot don't pollute](/img/blogspot-stuff-70-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-70.jpg "give a hoot don't pollute")

I drove by lake Tahoe, and I kept expecting some kind of 'scenic view' pulloff to the side of the road, but left disappointed. Anyway, it didn't take long to get to the woods, only a few hours drive today.

[![rocks below, sky above](/img/blogspot-stuff-71-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-71.jpg "rocks below, sky above")

Not much to talk about as far as the forest goes, just lots of trees and rocks and dirt. I parked at the trailhead, packed up my gear, and walked probably 3 or 4 miles out.

[![found a nice little spot to camp](/img/blogspot-stuff-72-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-72.jpg "found a nice little spot to camp")

Once I got tired of walking I struck off the trail and found a spot to camp, hung my food in a tree, and went to sleep. Didn't see any bears, but I heard a number of gunshots off in the distance.


### West Coast Day 11 - Yosemite

Woke up, packed up, and walked out of the woods this morning.

[![winding highway through the hills](/img/blogspot-stuff-73-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-73.jpg "winding highway through the hills")

Only a few hours of driving along winding mountain roads today. I probably got passed by 10 different people doing 60mph on their crotch rockets. I was taking a leak on the side of the road when one guy passed, and he caught his knee on the pavement and almost wiped out. Maybe I distracted him. Or her.

[![sun above the trees](/img/blogspot-stuff-74-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-74.jpg "sun above the trees")

Anyway, I got to Yosemite without a problem.

[![tall drink of water](/img/blogspot-stuff-75-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-75.jpg "tall drink of water")

I entered the park at the southern end, by the grove of sequoias, and toured that part today. My first impression was that the trees are so big they look fake. Some notable trees are:

[![grizzly giant](/img/blogspot-stuff-76-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-76.jpg "grizzly giant")

The 'Grizzly Giant'

[![faithful couple](/img/blogspot-stuff-77-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-77.jpg "faithful couple")

The 'Faithful Couple'

[![clothespin](/img/blogspot-stuff-78-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-78.jpg "clothespin")

'Clothespin'

[![dusty feet](/img/blogspot-stuff-79-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-79.jpg "dusty feet")

Probably shouldn't have worn sandals. The trails were really dusty.

[![half dome in the distance](/img/blogspot-stuff-80-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-80.jpg "half dome in the distance")

Half Dome is waiting for me tomorrow.


### West Coast Day 12 - Half Dome

_10/1/2012_

Woke up at 6am, got dressed, grabbed my gear (pre-packed the night before), and started walking. I met this guy named David (or was it Jason?) at the start of the trail, we started talking, and ended up hiking some of the trail together. He was hiking a bit faster than I was, so eventually I started lagging behind, huffing and puffing like a chubby kid.

[![vernal falls](/img/blogspot-stuff-81-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-81.jpg "vernal falls")

The first notable thing on the Mist Trail, besides all the frigging stairs, is the Vernal Falls. It was a nice spot to rest and get some food before starting to climb again.

[![nevada falls](/img/blogspot-stuff-82-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-82.jpg "nevada falls")

Next stop (not really, I stopped a lot to catch my breath, climbing steps is hard work) was Nevada Falls. This is about all you can see from this trail, the Muir trail gets a lot closer. But that's later.

[![back of half dome](/img/blogspot-stuff-83-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-83.jpg "back of half dome")

The next bit of trail is a wonderfully flat walk through Yosemite Valley, where the back side of Half Dome is visible. Soon after that there's a ranger who checks permits (I wonder if he has to climb the trail every day), and then more climbing of course.

[![half dome in the distance](/img/blogspot-stuff-84-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-84.jpg "half dome in the distance")

Most of this is in the woods, kind of standard hiking fare, but the trail loops around and soon Half Dome is in sight for real. But it's still a ways off.

[![view from the subdome](/img/blogspot-stuff-85-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-85.jpg "view from the subdome")

Getting to the subdome is not so bad, relatively, and there are starting to be some great views at this point.

[![climbing the subdome](/img/blogspot-stuff-86-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-86.jpg "climbing the subdome")

And then climbing up the subdome, which in my opinion was the worst part of the hike. All the way up is switchback steps along the rock. There are few trees, little shade, and by this point I was totally out of energy. But the end is in sight.

[![view of the cables from the subdome](/img/blogspot-stuff-87-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-87.jpg "view of the cables from the subdome")

Finally, mercifully, at the top of the subdome, I stopped and ate some lunch in the sun. There were squirrels running around looking for crumbs, and I watched them for a few minutes to take my mind off things.

[![up the cables](/img/blogspot-stuff-88-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-88.jpg "up the cables")

Eventually it had to be done. The climb up the cables was actually not bad. A couple people at the front of the pack were going somewhat slow, so it gave me time to catch my breath after every couple of sections. The girl behind me sounded like she was hyperventilating.

[![finally on top](/img/blogspot-stuff-89-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-89.jpg "finally on top")

One section at a time up the cables, and pretty soon I was at the top. It was just that easy.

[![this picture makes me nervous](/img/blogspot-stuff-90-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-90.jpg "this picture makes me nervous")

Thanks to David/Jason for this picture

[![view from half dome](/img/blogspot-stuff-91-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-91.jpg "view from half dome")

And THEN, I had to do it all again in reverse. Climbed down the cables backwards. Walked everything back downhill, which I rather preferred.

[![some other big rock](/img/blogspot-stuff-92-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-92.jpg "some other big rock")

D/J and I split at the Mist/Muir junction. He had a lot of driving ahead of him. So I took the Muir trail, which had a nice view of Nevada falls, and Half Dome, and some other big rock.

[![horses with no riders](/img/blogspot-stuff-93-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-93.jpg "horses with no riders")

The Muir trail didn't have all the steps like the Mist trail (but it was a mile or so longer), so people could ride animals up the trail. There was a lot of poop on the Muir trail.

[![parting shot of half dome](/img/blogspot-stuff-94-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-94.jpg "parting shot of half dome")

Hking up took about 5 and 1/2 hours. Hiking back down took 3 and 1/2 hours. I got a shower, ate dinner, drank one beer, and went to bed at 7pm. It was a pretty good day.

### West Coast Day 13 - King's Canyon

_10/2/2012_

Just a little bit of driving today, out to Fresno then back to the park.

[![general grant tree](/img/blogspot-stuff-95-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-95.jpg "general grant tree")

This one is called 'General Grant', and it's the 3rd largest tree in the world (by volume).

[![hills in the distance](/img/blogspot-stuff-96-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-96.jpg "hills in the distance")

But that's enough pictures of big trees, how about some more rocks?

[![hume lake](/img/blogspot-stuff-97-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-97.jpg "hume lake")

And I drove down to Hume Lake, and walked part ways around it so that I won't be so sore tomorrow.

[![trees around the lake](/img/blogspot-stuff-98-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-98.jpg "trees around the lake")

Ok I lied, more pictures of trees.

[![grizzly falls](/img/blogspot-stuff-99-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-99.jpg "grizzly falls")

Grizzly Falls, down in the canyon somewhere.

[![some meadow I dunno](/img/blogspot-stuff-100-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-100.jpg "some meadow I dunno")

I walked around this meadow for a bit, then went back and set up camp. Tomorrow is finally the actual west coast!


### West Coast Day 14 - San Luis Obispo

_10/3/2012_

Pretty easy drive today, took highway 41 all the way out to the coast.

[![morro rock](/img/blogspot-stuff-101-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-101.jpg "morro rock")

The first thing I saw was Morro Rock in Morro Bay. But this is not quite the coast yet, because this area is an estuary. So that doesn't count.

[![pismo beach](/img/blogspot-stuff-102-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-102.jpg "pismo beach")

I drove to the Pismo Beach area where I could park and see the actual coast. So that's technically done, but there was not much of a beach.

[![montana del oro beach](/img/blogspot-stuff-103-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-103.jpg "montana del oro beach")

Found a beach at the end of Montana Del Oro State Park. It was pretty nice.

[![getting dark at the beach](/img/blogspot-stuff-104-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-104.jpg "getting dark at the beach")

Killed some time looking for seashells.

[![lots of little seashells](/img/blogspot-stuff-105-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-105.jpg "lots of little seashells")

Found a few.

[![over 4 dollars for gas](/img/blogspot-stuff-106-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-106.jpg "over 4 dollars for gas")

On a different note, gas prices are silly out here.


### West Coast Day 15 - Up the Coast to Monterey

_10/4/2012_

This morning I went to Hearst Castle. More like worst castle, am I right?

Actually it wasn't too bad. The 45 minute movie was a little much, but it worked to kill time until my tour started. I think they plan it that way.

And I forgot my swim trunks, so I didn't get in the pool.

There is a lot of road work going on everywhere I've been in California. I guess road improvement is a good thing, but sitting in line waiting for the 'Stop' to change to 'Slow' is getting old.

And the scenery along the way isn't too bad either, so the driving wasn't a big deal today.

The elephant seals were out in force as well today. Those are some big blubbery animals.

And I eventually found Pfeiffer Beach, which is down an unmarked one lane road in the middle of nowhere. There was a lot of kelp and seaweed washed up on the shore, and a couple of jellyfish.

The last thing I did today was the 17 Mile Drive at Pebble Beach. Basically just more coastal views, but they have some interesting trees there.

This is called the 'Ghost Tree' because the trunk has been bleached white by the surf or sun or clorox or something.
