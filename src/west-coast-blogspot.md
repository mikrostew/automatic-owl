### West Coast Pre-Trip Stuff

_9/18/2012_

[![enso tattoo](/img/blogspot-stuff-27-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-27.jpg "enso tattoo")

The pre-trip tattoo is very important, I think. When translated, this tattoo means:

> Leaf after leaf in the pure wind, As I see you off at the gate, there are tall bamboo. Just for you, their leaves are raising a pure wind.

I got it done on Monday at Marks of the Spark in Frederick. Alfie and his wife own the business, and he does all of the tattoos. I talked to him some before he started, and he said that in January they will have been in business for 20 years in Frederick. Very cool. I got this design from a book of enso paintings. Enso just means 'circle' in Japanese, but it's traditionally the symbol of enlightenment in Zen, and a lot of the old Zen masters have drawn the circle in their own way. I looked through a lot of them, and this one jumped out at me. I still liked it a couple months later, so now it's on my body.

Also, planning. I took some pages out of my old road atlas and taped them up on the wall. I found a lot of info about where to go and what to see, but I didn't know where a lot of these places were in relation to each other, so I mapped it all out. I'm planning to be on the road for 5 and 1/2 weeks, starting on the 20th of September. Here we go.


### West Coast Day 1 - MD to Stone Mountain State Park, NC

_9/20/2012_

[![campsite setup](/img/blogspot-stuff-29-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-29.jpg "campsite setup")

This trip was only about 6 hours, but now I remember why I dislike interstates. Every other vehicle on the road was a semi on I-81 and I-77. Oh well, I listened to some good music and sang along to Creedence so it wasn't all bad. And I downloaded a lot of talks from Gil Fronsdal before I left. He's a Buddhist teacher somewhere in California, I'm not sure where. I need to find out and maybe stop in while I'm out that way.

Anyway, it wasn't too hard to find the park, and the route I took had me on the Blue Ridge Parkway for 10 miles or so. Got to see some mountains off in the distance, and I passed a lot of motorcycles going the other way. I stopped at Walmart during the day and bought some hotdogs and buns, so once I got a fire going I roasted the dogs on a sharpened stick. I ate four, they were delicious. It was cold out too, so I slept pretty good.

###  West Coast Day 2 - NC to Stockbridge, GA

_9/21/2012_

When I got up I saw a few deer wanderina through the campground a couple of sites down. They acknowledged me and went about their grazing. The campground had hot showers, so I got off to a good start.

Still a lot of semis on the road. Didn't matter, because I kinda tuned everything out today and just drove. Stopped at Chickfila for breakfast and Waffle House for lunch. Two of my favorite places in one day! Once I got to my parents house, I talked to Dad for a little bit since he was home on his day off. Then he enlisted me to move the freezer from the garage down to the basement. I guess I have to earn my lodging somehow.

The rest of the day was the usual good times with family: cooking, drinking, talking, alcoholic pudding, etc. Lilly is still skinny but alive. The other two cats are still fat and retarded. Forgot to take pictures of anything today.


### West Coast Day 3 - GA to Trace State Park, MS

_9/22/2012_

I am currently typing all of the previous entries up through today at the campground. I got here without much fuss, pretty much highway all the way. And not a lot of traffic at all once I got clear of Atlanta. I stopped for lunch at a Subway, but there must have been 30 people in line when I got there. Looked like a girls soccer team had just arrived. So I went unwillingly to the McD's next door, which I guess is technically food, but only technically.

Anway this park is kinda cool, they have a lot of trails for horses and ATVs and dirt bikes and stuff. I forgot that I gain an hour since I'm in Central time now, so I had extra time to wander around the woods. None of those trails was marked very well, and there were a lot of side trails, so I did my best to make a big loop. There were a lot of deer in the woods, I probably saw 20 of them, in groups of 2s and 3s.

And there was a 'nature trail', which was just a flat trail that wound around beside one of the lakes for maybe a mile and a half. I ran some of that, it was fun. I need to stay in shape to do Half Dome, and right now I'm sitting in the car for most of the day.

Now the stars are coming out, and I'm typing on the laptop in the dark. The sun went down around 7:30, which is crazy. The tattoo still itches and I want to scratch it but I can't. Gonna read for a bit and pass out. Forgot to take pictures again. Peace.


### West Coast Day 4 - MS to Devils Den State Park, AR

_9/23/2012_

Packed up, got a shower, and got on the road by 8am this morning. A week ago I was still asleep by then, although it is Central time so that's less impressive.

[![tunnel time](/img/blogspot-stuff-32-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-32.jpg "tunnel time")

The highlight of the drive today was a 'scenic overlook' that was basically a kind-of high point with a view of a lake. I took a picture of it, I don't know why. Then at some point there was a tunnel, almost as good. I found a Starbucks on the 2nd try (stupid GPS) so I could finally post stuff from the previous days. It was only supposed to be 7 hours of driving today, but with detours and what not I didn't get to the park until 530pm. Oh well.

[![rock wall at Devil's Den](/img/blogspot-stuff-33-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-33.jpg "rock wall at Devil's Den")

The park was pretty cool. There was still some light, so I hiked a couple of the trails and remembered to bring my camera this time. Once I was done with that I set up camp and made dinner. Tomorrow will be an even longer day on the road.

**Side note:** Car issues. When I changed the oil before I left for this trip, I wanted to change the air filter, but forgot to buy one. So I picked one up on the 3rd day, and then found out that the screws were too tight for my ratcheting screwdriver. So I bought a simple phillips head today, no problem. But the last screw was so tight that I stripped out the frigging head. Ugh. Thankfully it also takes a socket, which of course I didn't bring. So now I have to get that tomorrow. Assuming that goes well I might just have this replaced.


### West Coast Day 5 - AR to Palo Duro Canyon State Park, TX

_9/24/2012_

Woke up early, broke camp, and had to wait until 8am at the visitor center to pay for the campsite. Oh well.

[![windmills](/img/blogspot-stuff-36-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-36.jpg "windmills")

Today was the day of driving through Oklahoma. All of it was on I-40. All day. Everything started out kinda flat, and slowly got flatter and flatter. It was windy like crazy, which I suppose is why they have wind generators all over the place. Somewhere in the middle I stopped for lunch, gas, and walmart. Now I have sockets so I can finally change out my air filter. Hooray.

PD Canyon is kind of awesome as it turns out. Not Grand Canyon awesome, but very cool in its own way. I didn't get there until 5pm, so not a lot of time for hiking. But there was a 1.5 mile trail that went from a lookout point near the visitors center down to the canyon floor, and I hiked that. It turned out to be a really cool hike, all downhill. Then of course I turned around and walked back the other way, which was not so fun in the 90 degree (dry) heat, but I made it happen.

[![more canyon](/img/blogspot-stuff-40-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-40.jpg "more canyon")

All of the campsites are down inside the canyon, which is where I'm staying tonight. It's pretty windy still, hope I don't blow away.


### West Coast Day 6 - TX to Mesa Verde NP, CO

_9/25/2102_

There were supposed to be tarantulas all over the place in Texas since it's their breeding season, or so I was told. I didn't see any until I was leaving the park. They were running across the road, and I tried not to hit them with the car. Mostly successful.

[![long flat highway](/img/blogspot-stuff-41-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-41.jpg "long flat highway")

So today was a 10-hour day on the road. It started out flat and boring in Texas, but eventually I got through New Mexico and into Colorado, where they have mountains. So that was a nice change of pace.

[![mesas](/img/blogspot-stuff-42-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-42.jpg "mesas")

At some point after lunch, it started hailing on one of the mountains. That was the first precipitation so far on the trip. And now it's pretty cold here. I passed a couple of places where there was a little bit of snow on the ground.

[![cave dwellings](/img/blogspot-stuff-43-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-43.jpg "cave dwellings")

Since I spent so much time on the road, I got to the park too late to tour the cliff dwellings. Oh well, I got a picture of what there was to see from the beginning of the trail, then set up camp. It's still cold. Glad I brought my warm sleeping bag. And it turns out they have wifi here at the camp, so I'll be able to do some internets in the morning.

I had just had knee surgery so I didn't get to hike around, but I was blown away. And there's a crocodile park near it that I wanted to stop at...
