All that shop detail is zero. They don’t care to know and they don’t _need_ to know. Just make your book so it will read handily and let it go at that.

[^wad]: He wrote this in an essay for _Publishers’ Weekly_ in 1939, according to <https://www.paulshawletterdesign.com/2016/08/the-definitive-dwiggins-no-36-knopf-colophons/.>


### Technology

This site is built with [eleventy](https://github.com/11ty/eleventy), which I like so far --- it's fast and configurable.

I host this with [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com), which has been easy to setup and use.

Previously, I was using [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/), but it only supports liquid templates (which are [not great](https://aioo.be/2018/06/17/Why-I-hate-Shopifys-Liquid-Template-Language.html), and the main reason I stopped liking Jekyll).


### Typography

The [404 page](/404.html) uses the [More Perfect DOS VGA](http://laemeur.sdf.org/fonts/) font from Adam Moore (who adapted it from [Zeh Fernando's work](https://zehfernando.com/2015/revisiting-vga-fonts/)), which is licensed as free for all use.

Everything else uses whatever the default font is for your browser.
