After the takeover by Elon Musk, I no longer felt comfortable having my data on Twitter. This is what I did to remove as much as possible.


### Unfollow Everyone

I wrote an [in-browser script](https://github.com/mikrostew/scripts/blob/main/in-browser/twitter-unfollow-all.js) to unfollow everyone.

I was following 492 accounts when I started this, and it took about 18 minutes to run that to completion and unfollow everyone.

### Unlike Everything

I started out with a lot of likes:

[![4,498 likes](/img/twitter-2.png)](/img/twitter-2.png "4,498 likes")

So I wrote [another in-browser script](https://github.com/mikrostew/scripts/blob/main/in-browser/twitter-unlike-all.js) to unlike everything. I had to run that multiple times, because after a few hundred unlikes, it would start failing with  a 'too many requests' error.

Even after unliking everything I could, there are still a bunch of likes that I can't see:

[![hmm](/img/twitter-3.png)](/img/twitter-3.png "hmm")

I don't know how to delete those phantom likes, so I stopped waiting for anything to show up.

Everything else I did manually.


### Delete Tweets & Retweets

I did this manually, and it only took a little while since I had about 100 of these.


### Delete DMs

I only had like 10 of these, so it was easy. It probably doesn't matter though, since I assume twitter keeps those around for the other people in the conversations.


### Reset Topics

For all the topics I had marked "[not interested](https://twitter.com/mikrostew/topics/not_interested)", I undid that.


### Untag myself

I did that at <https://twitter.com/notifications/mentions>, and only had to remove a few places where I had been tagged.


### Download my data

I couldn't find anything else to remove, so I downloaded my data to check: <https://twitter.com/settings/download_your_data>.

After clicking "Request Data" I had to wait for a while, then I got a notification a few hours later.

Most of the data (probably 95%) was all the ads I've seen, and the reason I was targeted for them. The rest was data that twitter had inferred about me, like age, gender, and other demographic stuff, a lot of which was not correct.


### The End

I made some tweets about this process, and left a link to this site. My work was done.


### Aftermath

Well, almost done. I still had the app on my phone, and I opened it at some point later.

Guess there's no going back now.
