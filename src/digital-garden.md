streams vs gardens

I have been doing some form of blogging [for a while]({% link_to 'appalachian-trail-blogspot' %}), and I have mostly approached it from the mindset of traditional publishing. If I was going to post something, it needed to be complete, and thought-out, and was in my mind a fixed thing. Once it was "published", I was hesitant to change it. As if it had been printed in a magazine or something.

But as I have been putting things online in various iterations of this website, my view has changed.

It seems to me that one of the fundamental properties of the internet is the ability to edit, modify, learn, progress, etc.

This is not like submitting something to a printer, where it will go out in a fixed form. It is able to be changed at any time (except for twitter, they never did make an edit button).

That is how I envision this site. It's not a set of polished, published articles, but more of a free-form work-in-progress wiki. Not everythign has to be an article. I can put up notes, or ideas, or little projects, or any kind of thing I want. I don't have to abide by the conventions of traditional blogging.

That maybe there are some expectations of a reverse-chronological set of polished articles

gardening metaphor - planting seeds of ideas, letting them grow and develop over time

interconnected with the rest of the ideas in the garden

I don't know how something like RSS works for this though, although I already have a section for things I've shared, so maybe just put those things on RSS?

indeed, Chris K has some thoughts on why they are not a good match, and some ideas to make them work better for gardens vs streams: https://v5.chriskrycho.com/essays/feeds-are-not-fit-for-gardening/

I don't have the time to write polished articles, but I do have time to iterate on seeds of ideas, add something here and there as it mulls around in my head over time

Maggie Appleton has a very nice writeup on the history of digital gardens: https://maggieappleton.com/garden-history

(she linked a thread with examples of these types of sites: https://twitter.com/Mappletons/status/1250532315459194880, but twitter is only viewable when logged in now, highlighting the importance of not relying on 3rd-party social media sites)

(but, also showing that it's often easier to post seeds of ideas on social media, and get lots of attention and conversation)

she also has a big list and lots of links on github: https://github.com/MaggieAppleton/digital-gardeners

anyway, some quotes from that article that stood out to me:

> They're not following the conventions of the "personal blog," as we've come to know it. Rather than presenting a set of polished articles, displayed in reverse chronological order, these sites act more like free form, work-in-progress wikis.

> They aren't refined or complete - notes are published as half-finished thoughts that will grow and evolve over time. They're less rigid, less performative, and less perfect than the personal websites we're used to seeing.

She says that Mike Caufield was the first person to really lay out this idea in a coherent way, in a youtube video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ckv_CjyKyZY, and later essay: https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/

> Caufield's main argument was that we have become swept away by streams

> But streams only surface the Zeitgeisty ideas of the last 24 hours. They are not designed to accumulate knowledge, connect disparate information, or mature over time.

> The garden is our counterbalance. Gardens present information in a richly linked landscape that grows slowly over time. Everything is arranged and connected in ways that allow you to explore.


> Gardens don't consider publication dates the most important detail of a piece of writing. Dates might be included on posts, but they aren't the structural basis of how you navigate around the garden. Posts are connected to other by posts through related themes, topics, and shared context.

> Gardens are never finished, they're constantly growing, evolving, and changing.

> It gives readers an insight into your writing and thinking process. They come to realise you are not a magical idea machine banging out perfectly formed thoughts, but instead an equally mediocre human doing The Work of trying to understand the world and make sense of it alongside you.

> Gardens are a chance to question the established norms of a 'personal website', and make space for weirder, wilder experiments.

> One goal of these hyper-personalised gardens is deep contextualisation. The overwhelming lesson of the Web 2.0 social media age is that dumping millions of people together into decontextualised social spaces is a shit show.



notes from Mike Caufield's essay: https://hapgood.us/2015/10/17/the-garden-and-the-stream-a-technopastoral/

> The Garden is the web as topology. The web as space. It’s the integrative web, the iterative web, the web as an arrangement and rearrangement of things to one another.

> In the stream metaphor you don’t experience the Stream by walking around it and looking at it, or following it to its end. You jump in and let it flow past. You feel the force of it hit you as things float by.
>
> It’s not that you are passive in the Stream. You can be active. But your actions in there — your blog posts, @ mentions, forum comments — exist in a context that is collapsed down to a simple timeline of events that together form a narrative.
>
> In other words, the Stream replaces topology with serialization. Rather than imagine a timeless world of connection and multiple paths, the Stream presents us with a single, time ordered path with our experience (and only our experience) at the center.

> The “conversational web”. A web obsessed with arguing points. A web seen as a tool for self-expression rather than a tool for thought. A web where you weld information and data into your arguments so that it can never be repurposed against you. The web not as a reconfigurable model of understanding but of sealed shut presentations.
>
> And a web that can be beautiful and still is beautiful on so many days. I can’t stress this enough. I’m not here to bury the Stream, I love the Stream.

> Everybody wants to play in the Stream, but no one wants to build the Garden.

> You want ethics of networked knowledge? Think about that for a minute — how much time we’ve all spent arguing, promoting our ideas, and how little time we’ve spent contributing to the general pool of knowledge.

he adds the idea of campfires

> Campfires - mostly blogging for me, though I know some folks gather around private slack groups too. My blog functions as a digital campfire (or a series of campfires) that are slower burn but fade relatively quickly over the timeframe of years. Connection forming, thinking out loud, self referencing and connection forming. This builds muscle, helps me articulate my thinking and is the connective tissue between ideas, people and more. While I’m not a daily blogger I’ve been blogging on and off for 10+ years.



notes on https://joelhooks.com/digital-garden

> Chronologically sorted pages of posts aren't how people actually use the internet.

> What makes a garden is interesting. It's personal. Things are organized and orderly, but with a touch of chaos around the edges.
