### Done With The AT For This Year

_6/4/2011_

My knee is not going to be fully healed for a while, so I'm done with the trail this year. I'm back in Maryland, and I have plenty of food left to eat:

[![lots of food in boxes](/img/blogspot-stuff-26-tn.JPG)](/img/blogspot-stuff-26.JPG "lots of food in boxes")


### Random Stuff While I'm Healing

_5/13/2011_

I'm hanging out in GA with my parents for a while so that my knee can heal. I still have the stitches in, but they will be out on Sunday. The cut is healing well, but inside the knee is really tight. I can only bend it about 45 degrees right now, and can't put much weight on it when bent.

So in the meantime I pulled some pictures and videos off my camera, and here they are.

The crew that rescued me off the mountain:

[![rescued in a stretcher](/img/blogspot-stuff-24-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-24.jpg "rescued in a stretcher")

The women's retreat at the Siler Bald shelter as they were figuring out how to put up their tents:

[![my tent is all the way to the right](/img/blogspot-stuff-25-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-25.jpg "my tent is all the way to the right")

That's about it for now. Hopefully my knee will continue to heal and I'll be back on the trail where I left off soon.


### I'm Dumb

_5/01/2011_

[![injured knee, bloody leg](/img/blogspot-stuff-23.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-23.jpg "injured knee, bloody leg")

Cut my knee open, maybe the end of my hike.

Distance today: 7.3 (20-something if you count the ambulance ride)

Total: 118.7

I had a good walk up to Wayah Bald, where there is a stone firetower with a great view of the surrounding mountains. Then I walked down to Wayah Bald shelter to get some lunch.

I was reading through the shelter register while eating lunch, and one guy in the log suggested climbing on the shelter roof since it was nice and warm during the day. So I went to the back of the shelter, where it was close enough to jump onto. I put my hands on the edge of the roof and jumped to put my knee up on the roof, but slipped in the leaves and my knee went right aganst the edge of the tin roof. It cut straight through to the kneecap.

After I got over the initial pain, I took my hand away to see how bad it was. It was a good cut, a couple inches wide, and it was bleeding a lot. I kept pressure on it, got the bleeding to mostly stop, then cut a piece of my shirt for a pressure bandage.

I turned my phone on, and had just a little bit of signal - yes! I called 911, and eventually was able to describe where I was. They sent a group of guys with a basket-stretcher thing that had a big rubber wheel on the bottom. They loaded me up and rolled me to the nearest gravel road, which was about a half mile away.

From there I was loaded into the ambulance and rode to the hospital. The doctor cleaned up my knee and they took xrays to make sure I didn't injure the bone. The bone was OK, and I managed to avoid the tendons in the area too. So the doctor stitched it up, 4 on the inside and 7 on the outside. I got a room at the Budget Inn here in Franklin, NC. That's where I'm posting this from now.

I dont know how long it will be before I can do any serious hiking on the leg, so this may be the end of the trip.


### Siler Bald

_4/30/2011_

[![view from Albert Mountain fire tower](/img/blogspot-stuff-22.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-22.jpg "view from Albert Mountain fire tower")

Even better view than yesterday.

Distance today: 19.6

Total: 111.4

I broke 100 miles today! The terrain is still relatively easy compared to most of GA, and the weather is still great, so I put some more miles under my feet today.

The only tough part of the day was the climb up Albert Mtn in the morning. It was all stairs and scrambling up rocks, but the view was worth it. There is a fire tower on top of the mountain, and you can climb most of the way up to get a complete 360 view of the entire area. It was awesome.

The rest of the day was just miles of hiking and food. But now I can have a couple of comfortable days until I get to Nantahala.

Ended the day with a campfire and chit chat with a group that's just out for the weekend. And there's a women's retreat camping here too, from somewhere in Atlanta, so it's like tent city at this campsite.

I still don't have cell signal here, so I'll have to wait to post this. I'm going to go lay out and look at the stars, then pass out.


### Carter Gap

_4/29/2011_

[![view from Standing Indian mountain](/img/blogspot-stuff-21.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-21.jpg "view from Standing Indian mountain")

Longest day yet, with the best view.

Distance today: 19.8

Total: 91.8

Said my goodbyes and got going around 7am. Crossed the GA/NC border soon after that, since it was only a few miles away. As soon as I got into NC the wind started blowing and the temp dropped probably 10 degrees.

The climb up Couthouse Bald was tough but it was done soon enough. There was no view there. Eventually I got to Standing Indian Mtn, which was a long even walk uphill. The view from the top was incredible (that's the picture in this post), and the weather was great. Blue sky, big puffy clouds here and there.

The rest of the hike was fairly even ground, some elevation but nothing that strenuous. I have a small blister on the back of my left heel, but otherwise I'm good. Craving real milk.


### GA-NC Border!

_4/29/2011_

[![decorated border tree](/img/blogspot-stuff-20.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-20.jpg "decorated border tree")

GA done!


### Plumorchard Gap

_4/28/2011_

[![this way to the gap](/img/blogspot-stuff-19.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-19.jpg "this way to the gap")

Short day, nice break.

Distance today: 8.0

Total: 72.0

Got up late (past sunrise) and got started about 8:30. Had a nice stroll to Dicks Gap, where some hikers told me that a tornado had passed through the Low Gap area last night. And that the storm killed 200-something people. Crazy.

Eventually I reached the top of a mountain that had enough signal so I could call my momma and tell her that I was OK. Then I had a nice walk to Plumorchard shelter, which is the nicest shelter I've seen so far. Huge timbers, 2 lofts, big firepit.

I was the first one there, but soon Dave and Tenderfoot (brothers) show up with King Bear (also their brother), Flying Leaf, Smores and a couple other hikers. Then a family of 3 (mom, dad, and young son) who are thru-hiking together show up, then a couple more hikers. We made a big fire and sat around and talked until dark. It was good times. I'm typing this from inside my tent, since I didnt feel like sleeping in the shelter.


### Deep Gap

_4/27/2011_

[![stayed in the shelter, out of the storms](/img/blogspot-stuff-18.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-18.jpg "stayed in the shelter, out of the storms")

Bad weather, but the afternoon was OK.

Distance today: 15.3

Total: 64.0

I wasnt the first one up today, because I didnt get up at 4:30am. But I got going early to stay ahead of the storms that were on the way.

It was cold, foggy and windy all morning. I had a couple of tough climbs today, up and down Rocky Mtn, then Tray Mtn after that. I slipped on a big wet rock on top of Rocky, and landed on my butt in the mud. That was right after I took the picture from the last post.

I stopped at Tray Mtn shelter for lunch, then made it to Deep Gap about 3:30. Hopefully the bulk of the storm won't pass through here.

Gonna do a short day tomorrow because the last couple of days have been tough.

Update:

I'm not dead, there was a lot of rain and lightning but no tornadoes where I was. I heard that a tornado passed through somewhere around Low Gap, so I hope anybody who was staying there is OK.


### View From Rocky Mtn

_4/27/2011_

[![view into the fog](/img/blogspot-stuff-17.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-17.jpg "view into the fog")

Beautiful fog


### Blue Mountain Shelter

_4/26/2011_

[![sat on this log to rest](/img/blogspot-stuff-16.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-16.jpg "sat on this log to rest")

Longest day yet!

Distance today: 18.1

Total: 48.7

Started off about 7:30 this morning, while most everybody else at the hostel was still sleeping. The weather is supposed to be getting bad, so I wanted to get some miles in before then.

The weather stayed cool because it was foggy until about 11am, so I was able to keep a good pace most of the morning. Most everybody from the hostel was planning on stopping at Low Gap for the night, but I had lunch there about 1pm and kept going. It was pretty flat from there so that was a nice way to end the hike.

There were a couple of guys, Dave and Tenderfoot, who were planning to come here, but they were moving slow and they haven't arrived yet. Also, first time in a shelter, hope the mice aren't too bad.


### Neels Gap

_4/25/2011_

[![Mountain Crossing hostel](/img/blogspot-stuff-15.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-15.jpg "Mountain Crossing hostel")

Got up and over Blood Mountain today, but it was a relatively short trip to Neels Gap.

Distance today: 9.1

Total: 30.6

It was foggy all morning, which was fine since it stayed cool most of the day. The trek up the mountain wasnt as bad as I expected, and now I'm relaxing at mountain crossing hostel, got a shower and pizza. Yum!


### Happy Easter

_4/24/2011_

[![selfie with some mountains](/img/blogspot-stuff-14.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-14.jpg "selfie with some mountains")

Today (yesterday, I'm typing this early in the morning) was a long day.

Distance today: 16.4

Total: 21.5

Since the area between Jarrard Gap and Neels Gap is closed due to bears, I did some extra miles today. Now I'll be at Neels Gap on Monday afternoon instead of Tuesday morning.

I met a few other hikers with the same idea, and we all camped together here on Big Cedar mountain. There are a number of deer wandering around the area, and they woke me up a couple times last night. At least they aren't bears.


### Bear Sighting!

_4/24/2011_

[![stuffed bear on a stump](/img/blogspot-stuff-12.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-12.jpg "stuffed bear on a stump")

I took immediate evasive action...


### 1 2 3 GO!

_4/23/2011_

[![AT plaque for the southern terminus](/img/blogspot-stuff-13.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-13.jpg "AT plaque for the southern terminus")

Today is the first day of the rest of my life (whatever that means).

In related news, I started hiking the trail today! Mom and I started hiking above Amicalola falls a little after 10am. She turned around after an hour or so, and I got to the top of Springer around 2:30.

It was a gorgeous day, and there were a ton of people out hiking. I stopped somewhere after Long Creek falls and made camp up on the ridge of whatever mountain this is.

Distance today: 12.8

Total: 5.1

(These don't match because the approach trail up to Springer is not canon. So I'm not counting it for the total because I don't want to do that math every day.)


### Packing Complete!

_4/22/2011_

[![boxes of food to mail along the trail](/img/blogspot-stuff-11-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-11.jpg "boxes of food to mail along the trail")

Finished packing up food for the trip, which my awesome parents will mail to me!

That's all for now - flying to GA tomorrow to see my parents and pack up a bunch of food. Fun!


### Testing the Tent

_4/19/2011_

No updates in a while, but I have good excuses: Mom was in town, then Brian was in town, and then I was lazy.

Anyway, I just hiked out to Rocky Run shelter from the washington monument parking lot. About 4 miles. I stopped halfway to cook dinner, and as soon as I lit the stove it started raining. Whatever, I still managed to cook dinner. Salmon and potatoes, yum. And then as soon as I finished eating the rain stopped. Great timing.

I got here about 8pm, just as the light was running out, and set up the tent and stuff. It's supposed to rain overnight, so I hope I did a good job sealing the tent seams.


### No Pictures

_4/3/2011_

Didnt take any pictures today. Hiked 8 miles with 22 pounds, round trip from Turners gap to White Rock cliff and back.

It was a nice day, lots of people were out on the trail. Finally warm enough to hike in shorts. Yay Spring!


### 8 Miles

_4/1/2011_

Hiked 8 miles on the AT yesterday. There was still snow on the ground:

[![snow on the AT](/img/blogspot-stuff-10-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-10.jpg "snow on the AT")

Went down to the pogo campsite and back. It was cold out, I had 20 lbs on my back. The shoes feel good, my feet feel good.

Saw some flurries, but nothing much. Hope the snow is done.


### It's Cold Outside

_3/31/2011_

Hiked 7 miles today at Gambrill. There's still snow on the ground up there.

[![Gambrill yellow trail](/img/blogspot-stuff-8-tn.JPG)](/img/blogspot-stuff-8.JPG "Gambrill yellow trail")

I didn't see anybody else on the trail, but there were bike tracks along the trail.

[![bike tracks in the snow](/img/blogspot-stuff-9-tn.JPG)](/img/blogspot-stuff-9.JPG "bike tracks in the snow")

I loaded the pack up with stuff, it weighed a little over 17 lbs when I started out. It's comfortable, fits against my back well, feels good.

It drizzled most of the time I was there, and this time I tightened the bag cover well around the pack. It didn't fall off, kept things dry. Saw some deer, good times.


### Stupid Is As Stupid Does

_3/30/2011_

Yesterday I bought some new gear - a pair of shoes (La Sportiva trail runners) and a balaclava. And the Mariposa pack that I ordered came in the mail. So I thought it would be a good idea to go for a hike and try this stuff out, start breaking the shoes in, etc.

The weather report called for a snow/rain mix, so at least I remembered to bring my rain shell.

But, I forgot where I put my camera, so I planned to take my phone and use it for pictures. I set it on the counter, and then forgot to bring it with me. So no pictures for this adventure. And I forgot to bring the balaclava, but no big loss there, plenty of time to test it out.

I only hiked 3 miles, the black trail at Gambrill. It started snowing about 5 minutes after I got there, so I put my bag cover on the pack. But I forgot that it was set up for my other pack, so it didn't fit very tight. After about 45 minutes there was a half inch of snow on the ground, and it started hailing. Awesome. But I got back to the car soon after that, and realized the bag cover had fallen off somewhere along the trail.

So I jogged back along the trail, and the bag cover was only about a half mile back. And that was the end of that.


### Phone Test

_3/29/2011_

Hopefully this will work - here is a picture from Black Rock cliffs the other day, using the phone camera:

[![Black Rock cliffs](/img/blogspot-stuff-7-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-7.jpg "Black Rock cliffs")

On a different subject, I started watching Moonraker with dinner but I had to stop - that is a terrible Bond movie.


### 10 Miles, No Views

_3/29/2011_

I parked at the Washington monument campground today. Then I hiked south on the AT for about 5 miles, to Lambs Knoll. The guide said that there was a view at the top of the knoll, near the tower. But all I saw was the tower:

[![Lamb's Knoll tower](/img/blogspot-stuff-6-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-6.jpg "Lamb's Knoll tower")

Whatever. There was some good uphill, got my heart going and my lungs out of breath.

I finally remembered to weigh my day pack before I left this time - 12.5 pounds. Not bad, that's about half the weight that my real pack will be when it's fully loaded with gear and food and everything. So I'm getting there.

Speaking of packs, I ordered a Mariposa Plus pack a few days ago, and it should be here tomorrow. It weighs a little less than 1.5 pounds, compared to my current pack that weighs over 3 pounds. Just trying to save weight wherever I can.


### 8 Miles, Overlooks

_3/28/2011_

Hiked 8 Miles on Monday. Started at the US40/I-70 parking lot, like the day before. Went about 4 miles north on the AT, up to the Pogo Memorial campsite. On the way I passed a couple of overlooks. The first was Annapolis Rocks. I took a picture with my phone, to see how its camera looks:

[![Annapolis Rocks](/img/blogspot-stuff-4-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-4.jpg "Annapolis Rocks")

It's not bad. I'm thinking of leaving my camera at home and just using the camera on the phone. Less batteries to worry about, less weight to carry, and I won't be able to get the images off the camera without a computer anyway. But I haven't decided for sure, I'm going to get my phone set up to be able to post to this blog and see how images work with that.

Anyway, I did bring my camera this time. The second overlook was at Black Rock cliffs, and I used the camera to get the images for a panorama:

[![Black Rock cliffs](/img/blogspot-stuff-5-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-5.jpg "Black Rock cliffs")

I have been using the program [Hugin](https://hugin.sourceforge.io/) to stitch the images together. It works pretty good most of the time.

So that was about it for the day, 8 miles round trip. Good weather, a little cold. Only a few other people out on the trail.

On a different note, I'm really glad I bought a pair of thin gloves. When walking on flat ground or downhill they keep my hands warm. I don't need them going uphill because the exertion keeps everything toasty.


### Washington Monument

_3/26/2011_

Did a 6 mile round trip to Washington monument park on Sunday. Parked the car at the US40/I-70 parking lot, and walked the 3 miles south along the AT to the Washington monument. It's not the same thing as the big 4-sided spike thing in DC. This one is just a round stone tower on top of a hill. Apparently it was used as a look-out by the north during the civil war. Whatever. I walked the stairs to the top (it's not very tall, I should have taken a picture), looked around, then walked back to the car. It only took a couple of hours, and it was a nice day on top of that.


### Good Weather and Deer at Gambrill

_3/24/2011_

I'm still doing battle with the sore throat/runny nose combo, and I didn't feel that great today. But, it was clear out (and cold) so I wanted to hike at least a little bit. So I drove to Gambrill and hiked the black trail. It's only 3 miles, and took me about an hour. I took a panorama from the second overlook:

[![overlook](/img/blogspot-stuff-1-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-1.jpg "overlook")

I only saw one other person on the trail, but as I was walking around the park headquarters area I saw some deer. Ten of them. Two of them were on my left:

[![two deer](/img/blogspot-stuff-2-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-2.jpg "two deer")

They saw me at about the same time I saw them, decided I wasn't much of a threat and kept doing their thing. The other eight deer were farther down to my right:

[![eight deer](/img/blogspot-stuff-3-tn.jpg)](/img/blogspot-stuff-3.jpg "eight deer")

They weren't afraid of me either. I guess I need to work on being more intimidating.


### Miserable Weather at Catoctin

_03/23/2011_

I was sick on Tuesday so I didn't hike at all, but Wednesday (yesterday) I felt better so I drove up to Catoctin and hiked around there. It was in the low 50s, maybe colder at the higher altitudes. It never rained but it alternately misted and drizzled the whole time I was there. I hiked the trails for about 3 and a half hours, and it felt good to get outside and not be sick, even thought the weather was terrible.

I walked over to the falls, but didn't take any pictures because:
1. I forgot to bring my camera (dumb), and
2. even if I brought it, there was nothing to see.

Up at the top of some of the hills (I don't think these qualify as mountains), where normally there would be a scenic overlook, there was only a wall of fog. I saw a few deer as they ran away from me with their white tails stuck up in the air. That was about it, until I passed a group of four guys who were walking into the woods as I was heading out to the car.

Took a nap when I got home. It was a pretty good day.
