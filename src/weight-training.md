## Current Plan

### 3/27/2023 &ndash; present

Not a big style change, I'm enjoying the current superset style, building my strength base, but want to change out some exercises - things that aren't working well, or that I just don't like much, or that I'm bored of

Biggest change is probably starting to do BB squats again, and some strongman stuff

Continue doing the double progression, that is working well so far

Probably have a deload/transition week to get used to the new exercises


3 days/week, full body-ish

(Also jogging one day a week, Tuesday or Thursday)

Each workout starts with 4 min treadmill warmup (walk 1m30s, jog 1m30s, walk 1m)

[^juggernaut]: The [Juggernaut Method](https://www.jtsstrength.com/product/the-juggernaut-method-2-0/) uses block periodization to wave the weights and reps (good video by Alex Bromley [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4zciARr6VE) on YouTube). I have a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PNb4qpkdaOsrGKtGahjG_ZePQ3rMH7mehV146f2vp4M/edit#gid=442268171) to track the weights for this, which I initially copied from [this page](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/juggernaut-method-base-template-spreadsheet/), and modified so it was easier to do kg instead of lb.
