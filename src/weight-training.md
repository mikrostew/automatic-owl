## Next Program

What I'm planning to do next (starting April)

Not a big style change, I'm enjoying the current superset style, building my strength base, but want to change out some exercises - things that aren't working well, or that I just don't like much, or that I'm bored of

Biggest change is probably starting to do BB squats again, and some strongman stuff

Continue doing the double progression, that is working well so far

Probably have a deload/transition week to get used to the new exercises
