::: details Notes

This was a continuation of the previous block, since I was enjoying the superset style, and building my strength base.
I wanted to change out some exercises, things that weren't working well, or that I just didn't like, or that I was bored of.

Biggest change was probably starting to do BB squats again, and some strongman stuff.
I also started using the Juggernaut Method[^juggernaut] for the main lifts.

For accessories, I continued doing the double progression, that has been working well.

:::

After tweaking my back, I stopped doing things that were giving me low back issues, and started incorporating more stretching and mobility.

[^juggernaut]: The [Juggernaut Method](https://www.jtsstrength.com/product/the-juggernaut-method-2-0/) uses block periodization to wave the weights and reps (good video by Alex Bromley [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=S4zciARr6VE) on YouTube). I have a [spreadsheet](https://docs.google.com/spreadsheets/d/1PNb4qpkdaOsrGKtGahjG_ZePQ3rMH7mehV146f2vp4M/edit#gid=442268171) to track the weights for this, which I initially copied from [this page](https://liftvault.com/programs/strength/juggernaut-method-base-template-spreadsheet/), and modified so it was easier to do kg instead of lb.
