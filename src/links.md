### Current

[Strava](https://www.strava.com/athletes/mikrostew): I track runs and hikes there. I'm trying to [run once a week]({% link_to 'run-once-a-week' %}) this year.

[LinkedIn](https://www.linkedin.com/in/mikrostew): I will share posts there, if they are relevant professionally (I also work there).


### Unused / Abandoned

[Twitter](https://twitter.com/mikrostew): I used to post there infrequently, but I [removed my data]({% link_to 'bye-twitter' %}) and no longer use it.
