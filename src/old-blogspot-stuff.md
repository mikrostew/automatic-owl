### Good Weather and Deer at Gambrill

_3/24/2011_

I'm still doing battle with the sore throat/runny nose combo, and I didn't feel that great today. But, it was clear out (and cold) so I wanted to hike at least a little bit. So I drove to Gambrill and hiked the black trail. It's only 3 miles, and took me about an hour. I took a panorama from the second overlook:

I only saw one other person on the trail, but as I was walking around the park headquarters area I saw some deer. Ten of them. Two of them were on my left:

They saw me at about the same time I saw them, decided I wasn't much of a threat and kept doing their thing. The other eight deer were farther down to my right:

They weren't afraid of me either. I guess I need to work on being more intimidating.


### Miserable Weather at Catoctin

_03/23/2011_

I was sick on Tuesday so I didn't hike at all, but Wednesday (yesterday) I felt better so I drove up to Catoctin and hiked around there. It was in the low 50s, maybe colder at the higher altitudes. It never rained but it alternately misted and drizzled the whole time I was there. I hiked the trails for about 3 and a half hours, and it felt good to get outside and not be sick, even thought the weather was terrible.

I walked over to the falls, but didn't take any pictures because:
1. I forgot to bring my camera (dumb), and
2. even if I brought it, there was nothing to see.

Up at the top of some of the hills (I don't think these qualify as mountains), where normally there would be a scenic overlook, there was only a wall of fog. I saw a few deer as they ran away from me with their white tails stuck up in the air. That was about it, until I passed a group of four guys who were walking into the woods as I was heading out to the car.

Took a nap when I got home. It was a pretty good day.
